1. The most popular hypervisors is Hyper-V, VMware ESXi and KVM.
2. VMware more expensive solution, Hyper-V is cheaper, KVM even free. 
When calculating the cost of a virtualization system, 
you also need to consider the cost of the software licenses that will be installed 
in the virtual machines. This is why Hyper-V is much cheaper than VMware - with VMware, 
you still have to buy guest OS licenses.
Hyper-V is less demanding on hardware. KVM is the most unpretentious software, BUT KVM has 
no support service, instead of VMware and Hyper-V (free Hyper-V Server has no support service 
as well).
3. Installed Ubuntu on VirtualBox (VM1) and cloned it created second virtual machine (VM2) [2.1.png](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/2.1.png).
4. Created group of virtual machines and learned the functiones related to the groups.
5. Made few snapshots in different state [2.2.png](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/2.2.png).
6. Exported and imported VM to and from .ova file [2.3.png](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/2.3.png).
7. Configured USB and shared folder to exchange data between host and VM [2.4.png](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/2.4.png).
8. Configured network modes and checked connection between VM1 and VM2 [2.5.png](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/2.5.png).
9. Checked commands using VboxManage [2.6.png](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/2.6.png).
10. Installed Vagrant, initialized default box and proceed with the command "date" [3.1.PNG](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/3.1.PNG).
11. Deleted default vagrant box and created mine [3.2.png](https://github.com/JerryW1ld/DevOps_online_Kharkiv_2021Q2/blob/d3815c5d2d9bb1bd265943aa60120941d99e5376/task2.1/Pic2.1/3.2.png).
